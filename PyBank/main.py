#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

#The total number of months included in the dataset

#The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

#The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

#The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

#The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

#As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

# =============================================================================
# Financial Analysis
# ----------------------------
# Total Months: 25
# Total Revenue: $1241412
# Average Revenue Change: $216825
# Greatest Increase in Revenue: Sep-16 ($815531)
# Greatest Decrease in Revenue: Aug-12 ($-652794)
# =============================================================================
