# You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). 
# Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 
# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

# The total number of votes cast

# A complete list of candidates who received votes

# The percentage of votes each candidate won

# The total number of votes each candidate won

# The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

# Election Results
# -------------------------
# Total Votes: 620100
# -------------------------
# Rogers: 36.0% (223236)
# Gomez: 54.0% (334854)
# Brentwood: 4.0% (24804)
# Higgins: 6.0% (37206)
# -------------------------
# Winner: Gomez
# -------------------------
# Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly-structured dataset in the future 
# (i.e you have zero intentions of living in this hillbilly town -- so your script needs to work 
# without massive re-writes). In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to 
# the terminal and export a text file with the results.
